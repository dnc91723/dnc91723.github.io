		<p style="Font-family: impact ; font-size:16pt"> My name is Diamond Clark. I was born and raised in Atlanta, GA. I was born on 2:16 on February 12th, meaning that I am an <b>Aquarius</b>. I attend the University of Georgia, and I am a sophomore. My major is <b>Environmental Resource Science, and I have a minor in Environmental Law</b>. I plan on going to law school for environmental policy. </p>
		<p style="Font-family: impact ; font-size:16pt"> I have several hobbies that I enjoy when I am not doing school work or working. I have a love for <b>creating</b>, so in my spare time I enjoy painting. I also really enjoy reading; I read mostly fiction novels. I spend a lot of my free time volunteering as well. I volunteer at food banks, games, and plan to start volunteering with the local Humane Society soon. I also really enjoy traveling and hope to be able to do more of that as soon as possible. </p>
		<p style="Font-family: impact ; font-size:16pt"> <b>One of my biggest passions is animals.</b> I have a variety of species that I love, but my favorite is dogs. I have two dogs; one’s name is Leo, and the other’s name is Pup (we never took the time to give him a real name). I plan to adopt a dog soon when I move into my own apartment. I also really like snakes; I really would like to adopt a ball python when I am stable enough to provide a caring home. </p>
		<p style="Font-family: impact ; font-size:16pt"> That’s just a little something about me! </p>
